# Electronic-Health-Record-Using-Blockchain
Patient health data is very sensitive and digitization of healthcare data has led to increased concerns regarding patient privacy, data security, and control over personal health information. 
Healthcare organizations face numerous obstacles, including unauthorized access to sensitive patient information, data breaches, lack of transparency in data sharing, and difficulties in achieving regulatory compliance. 
This project proposes a solution that uses the decentralized and immutable nature of blockchain technology, integrated with the distributed storage capabilities of the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), to address these challenges effectively.
